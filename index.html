            Still here huh? Yeah the rest of the page is filled with nonsense garbage. It looks better than regular ipsum and it makes me smile. David Bowie died on Monday, or at least that's when we heard about it. For some reason I'm more bummed out about it than I have any right to be. There's only a few tracks I really care about, personally and he always seemed like a pop culture (space) oddity with slim relevance. Still, he was a celebrity that had always just been "there" and somehow mortally immortal. I figure Mick Jagger drained him of his life essence because he is obviously a vampire. For some reason I can't get my indentation just the way I want it in Sublime Text and it's really annoying.
